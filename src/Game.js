*
*   Description:
*    This is a card game called: In-between. This class is the main game class that
*    creates a game object in order to play in-between.
*
*   Author: q0r3y
*
*   Date: 11.15.20
*
*   Revised:
*
*   Rules:
*    Each player places the ante in the pot. During the game each player takes turns,
*    the game continues until there is no money left in the pot.
*    During a turn, the dealer deals two cards, face-up.
*    The player then decides to bet if they believe
*    the third card dealt will be in between (in rank) their two cards.
*    A bet can be between zero or the total value of the pot.
*    If the third card is in-between, that player wins their bet from the pot.
*    If the third card is not in-between the two, that player pays to the pot their bet.
*    If the third card is the same rank as one of the two,
*    they pay to the pot double their bet.
